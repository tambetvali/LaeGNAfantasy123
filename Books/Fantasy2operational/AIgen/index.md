# AI tasks

For help in coding, an AI is creating each class as an example:
- There can be important code snippets for accelerating the creation, also others can use those tasks on more advanced AI's and produce more ready code (today I'm using llama3.2:1b, perhaps later up to 7b or 13b if this returns nonsense).

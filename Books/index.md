# 🃏 Digital Fantasy

The books here are part of my ☯<font color="brightbrown">__Laegna__</font> ☤<font face="verdana" color="lightblue">_Spireason_</font>.
- I call topic for an AI to study a _book_, where here are 2 topics and a study server, 3 _books_.

I am going to do decimal system based mapping of ☯<font color="brightbrown">__Laegna__</font> numbers.

I might evolve several features here 👣, which are not exactly described at the mainpage: which rather would contain a very 🔮 basic implementation, where we can ☘ simplify later.

The icons are chosen to emulate a fantasy game, such as role playing fantasy game or turn based fantasy game: from times when I was gaming 🎅🎒.

Parts of this:
- 💃 Digit Implementation of Laegna
- 🏇 Operation Order Implementation of Laegna
- ☕ The digit server (in format of Laegna Math Webpage or compatible): it will read cards, replace numbers with Laegna-like numbers, and then serve the result to an AI or internet client.

# "Fantasy" of my math

I imply a trivial, decimal-system based implementation of my numbers and AI training cards under this repository.

It's not imagination, it's a fantasy: when you use it, you would understand some basics of my math, but the results would be imprecise; as in fantasy, unlike in imagination, the truth value bit is yielding.
